# MYflow
A simple computer program for rheological modelling of mylonites. 
MYflow is a Matlab-derived software that allow to calculate the flow stress and strain rate
of both monomineralic and multi-phase mylonite composed of different minerals and grain size distributions.

The software is provided with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that control several soub-routines
used to perform paleopiezometric analysis, calculate the bulk flow parameters of composite rocks from several mixing models, 
and display the results as either 0th-dimensional strength profiles in stress/strain-rate/temperature/grain size space, or as
2D plots showing the distribution of stress or strain-rate in a given microstructure. 

The code has been developed on Matlab (version R2021a). 

As the code is not compiled, there's no need to install any component on the PC before executing the software, you just need to have Matlab r2021a (or newer version) installed.

How to make the software works:
1. download the MYflow.zip folder
2. unzip the content of MYflow.zip
3. double click on the MYflow2.m file (this opens the Graphical User Interface, GUI)
4. Now the GUI is open and you can work your models by using the different menus (have a look at 
   the HELP menu to access a pdf file that explain the main functionalities of the program)
